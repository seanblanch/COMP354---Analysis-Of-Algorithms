Recommended Textbook:
Title: An Introduction to the Analysis of Algorithms, 3rd Edition
Author: Michael Soltys
Publisher: World Scientific Publishing Co. Pte. Ltd., 2018
ISBN: 978-981-3235-90-8

Instructional Approach and Course Structure:
This course will focus primarily on theory in the classroom, and homework assignments will venture into application.

Lectures:
Lectures will be given on Zoom.
Invite links to lectures can be found by clicking lectures on the Canvas Calendar or the appropriate Canvas Module.
Lectures will be recorded, and Zoom invite links will be replaced with links to the recordings shortly after lectures.
Links to alternative resources covering the same or very similar content will be provided for most lectures.
Kahoot quizzes will be held at the end of most lectures to solidify new material and review old material. Links to these quizzes will be included in the corresponding modules on Canvas.
Attendance:
Students will choose one of the following attendance policies before the second lecture. This choice is final, except in extenuating circumstances.

Standard Attendance: Attendance will be taken at some time during each lecture. Your attendance grade will be determined by your presence in the Zoom meeting at this time.
Async Attendance: Once per week, before Saturday at midnight, you will submit a 1-paragraph summary of each lecture given that week. Your attendance grade will be determined by your timely submissions of these summaries.
No Attendance: No attendance grade will be submitted for you. Exams and Homework will each be worth 10/9 of what their displayed weight in the syllabus to fill the 10% allocated to attendance.
Homework:
Challenging homework assignments will be given every 1-2 weeks (1-2 assignments per module).
Homework assignments will be graded based on completion. Students will not lose points for errors in attempted problems; problems which were not given an honest effort by the instructors determination, or which don't follow submission instructions, will not receive points.
Homework solutions will be released with or shortly after homework assignments are due. Students will have a week to complete a critique of their homework solutions. Students should use office hours during the critique week to ask for any needed clarification.
Homework critiques will be worth half as much as the corresponding homework assignments, and will be graded on correctness.
Detailed feedback will only be given on homework assignments in person, if sought in office hours. Feedback on Canvas will consist of some brief commentary and a grade.
Collaboration on homework assignments is enoucouraged, but all submitted work must be written by you in your own words. Homework submissions will have a field in which you can list those you collaborated with, but this does not mean your solutions can be identical. All submissions are individual.
Submission Requirements:
Assignment submissions will only be accepted through the assignment's designated file submission in Canvas. Submissions made through email, Canvas message, etc will be rejected.
Assignments will be submitted in an image format (pdf or png) so they can be marked up in Canvas.
The answers to all theoretical questions must be in a single image. Collections of images will be rejected. Cell phone pictures will be rejected; there are free apps which allow you to approximate the quality of a scanner using your cell phone camera, and these are acceptable.
Some assignments will include programming exercises, to be done in Python. Usually, you will be will instructed to include specific snippets of you Python code in your image submissions. When you are instructed to submit your source Python files themselves, they should be zipped up and attached separately from the image, so the image can still be marked up directly in Canvas.
No late work will be accepted. Do not leave work until the last minute and then ask for an extension; it will not be granted unless the circumstances are exceptional.
Midterms:
Midterms will be delivered in a flexible format:

Two midterm formats will be available: interview or paper.
Students may choose the format in which they feel most confident expressing themselves and their understanding of the material.
Students are encouraged to take the interview route (particularly those who find it nervewracking). Questions from this class are very likely to appear in technical interviews after graduation.
The written midterm will be available for 3 days. There will be no other time constraints placed on it, outside of the 3 day availability.
The written exam will necessarily be longer and harder than the interview, as you will have much more time to complete it.
The interview and written exams will be curved separately.
Students who do not sign up for an interview exam will be assumed to be choosing the written exam. Students who neither sign up for the interview nor submit a written exam will receive a 0 on the exam.
Refer to the Canvas Calendar or the Canvas Modules for exam dates. Exams are to be done individually, and will be curved. You may not communicate with anyone about the exam until everyone has submitted it, but otherwise have access to all resources.

Any violation of these or any other rules of the academic code, will result in automatic "F" and the offenders will be reported to the Judicial Affairs. If multiple individuals are involved in the violation (e.g., two students submit same, or in the judgement of the instructor very similar, work), then all will be sanctioned.

Final Exam:
The final exam will be given in two parts:

A written exam consisting of three questions, requiring students to:
Prove the correctness of a given algorithm
Evaluate the performance of a given algorithm
Propose or design an algorithm to solve a specified problem
An interview, requiring students to discuss several algorithms, data structures, and theoretical results covered throughout the semester.
Refer to the Canvas Calendar or the Canvas Modules for exam dates. Exams are to be done individually, and will be curved. You may not communicate with anyone about the exam until everyone has submitted it, but otherwise have access to all resources.

Any violation of these or any other rules of the academic code, will result in automatic "F" and the offenders will be reported to the Judicial Affairs. If multiple individuals are involved in the violation (e.g., two students submit same, or in the judgement of the instructor very similar, work), then all will be sanctioned.

Tools:
Some homework assignments will require you to work in Python. There are plenty of IDEs available for free, so the following is a recommendation only for students who don't already have a preference. JetBrains offers free licenses to students for all of their IDEs, including PyCharm. You can register for a student licence here: https://www.jetbrains.com/student. If you have trouble registering for a license or installing or using PyCharm or another IDE, feel free to reach out; I will do my best to help.

Grading:
10% Attendance

20% Homework

70% Exams:
   20% - Midterm 1
   20% - Midterm 2
   30% - Final Exam

The instructor reserves the right to adjust any grade in response to any new forthcoming relevant information that was unknown when the grade was determined. For example, if a student submitted work that was not based on their efforts, and that becomes known at some later time, then the grade will be changed accordingly.

Grade Letter Scheme:

The following grading scheme is used in this course:

98 - 100% - A+
94 - 97.99% - A
90 - 93.99% - A-
87 - 89.99% - B+
84 - 86.99% - B
80 - 83.99% - B-
77 - 79.99% - C+
74 - 76.99% - C
70 - 73.99% - C-
67 - 69.99% - D+
64 - 66.99% - D
61 - 63.99% - D-
anything below 61% - F

You have access to your grades in Canvas at all times to track your progress and are always welcome to contact the instructor with questions or concerns.

Grading Policy:

All exam work must be your own. Homework may be collaborative, but not shared. Your submitted work must be written, in its entirety, by you.. Plagiarism, defined as copying or receiving materials from a source or sources and submitting this material as one's own without acknowledging the source, or otherwise representing the work of others as your own, is NOT allowed and will result in 0% for the assignment. Sharing exam solutions with other students is also considered an Academic Dishonesty.
Any violation of these or any other rules of the academic code, will result in automatic "F" and the offenders will be reported to the Judicial Affairs. If multiple individuals are involved in the violation (e.g., two students submit same, or in the judgement of the instructor very similar, work), then all will be sanctioned.
Students will submit assignments, including exams, in Canvas. Other submissions (e.g., through email) will not be accepted.
Students should be prepared to defend their work; the instructor may initiate a discussion of the exams after the submission.
Community Rules:
In an effort to ensure our learning community develops, thrives and sustains throughout our time together, the following ground rules will be in effect at all times.

As a student in this program, you agree to:

Consider yourself a member of a community. A community is a group of individuals who work together to support a common goal or interest. We are working together to support the successful achievement of our learning outcomes.
Treat the diverse contributions made by other community members with respect.
Have patience and a sense of humor with technology. There will be hiccups, expect them.
Be a learner. Keep an open mind when introduced to new ideas that may challenge your perceptions.
Ask for help when you need it, and assist others when possible.
Understand that communications shared through text have a higher likelihood of being misinterpreted than words that are spoken. Therefore, when you type a thought or a comment, read it carefully before you submit it. If you question the way it is worded, read it out loud to yourself. If you still question the way it's phrased, re-write it.
Contribute regularly to group dialogue. The contributions of each individual plays a role in the collective strength and diversity of our community.
Treat others with decency. Respect others' boundaries.
If a Ground Rule is Violated

If, at any time, you feel that any of these ground rules has been violated by a member of our community, you are encouraged to bring your concern directly and immediately to your instructor. In your message, you may identify which ground rule has been violated and include specific evidence of the violation in your email, if you feel comfortable doing so. Otherwise, you are entitled to ask for references to appropriate campus personnel better equipped to handle such situations. Your concerns will be addressed promptly and with careful consideration.
