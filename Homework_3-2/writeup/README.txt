SOLUTION TEMPLATE INSTRUCTIONS

We have prepared a template for you in writeup/Homework_3-2.tex.

If you decide to write your solution in LaTeX, please modify it to
include all your answers, except for the Python source code, and then
upload the resulting pdf to Canvas.

To fill in the answer to a problem, e.g. Problem 2(c), search the document for
the answer start / end markers, which look like this:
    %%% PROBLEM 2(c) ANSWER START %%%
    %%% PROBLEM 2(c) ANSWER END %%%


COLLABORATORS

Remember to list the full names of your collaborators, separated by commas,
between the answer markers.
    %%% COLLABORATORS START %%%
    John Doe, Jane Doe
    %%% COLLABORATORS END %%%
