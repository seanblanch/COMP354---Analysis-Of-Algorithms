# Share or Steal

In this activity, you will define the behavior of a player in a game. Your player will play against those implemented by your classmates.

Against each opponent, you'll play $N$ rounds. A round will go as follows:

1. You and your opponent will being given a gift of \$4. You will each secretly make a choice between two options: share or steal.
2. Both choices are revealed.
3. If both players elected to share, they each receive \$2. If 1 player elects to share and the other selects to steal, the thief gets \$3 and leaves their more generous opponent with only \$1. If both players elect to steal, they both walk away empty-handed (they tore all four bills in half!).

Your goal is to maximize your own total profit as you play each of your classmates ($N$ times each). Making the right choices is the way to do so. The only information available to you is the list of decisions you've made while playing against this opponent, and the respective decisions they've made when playing against you.

Your player will be implemented in [ShareOrSteal.py](./ShareOrSteal.py). There are many sample definitions provided (search for `# EXAMPLE PLAYERS`) and there are instructions for how you will create your own player (search for `# PLAYER CREATION`).

When you are done, submit just your player definition in a text or python file (with comments stating group members if applicable).
